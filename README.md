# phase-3-w1-code-challenge
## CHALLENGE 1
- Define the function and pass in a parameter for hours, minutes and the time period (am and pm)
-Write an if statement that checks whether the input is valid. the time put in can only range from 1-12 for hours and 0-59 for minutes. if the input doesn't meet this criteria, return "not time"
-Write another if statement that checks if the input given is in the 'am' time period or the 'pm' time period. if it is in the 'am' set the hour to 00 so that it stays in the 12-hour clock system and if it is in the pm add 12 to the hours so it converts the time to the 24hr clock system
-have a result that prints out the hours and minutes using interpolation

## CHALLENGE 2
- Create and define a function with parameters a b and c
- write an if statement that checks if the integers are positive numbers(greater than or equal to 0) 
-return true if they all are positive and false if not all are positive

## CHALLENGE 3
- Create and define a function that takes in parameter word
-write an expression that converts a character/letter in the given word to its position in the alphabet
-write an if statement that checks whether there are any vowels in the word. if there are any write an expression to remove them
-take the position of the remaining consonants and get the sum of that
-print your resulting answer
